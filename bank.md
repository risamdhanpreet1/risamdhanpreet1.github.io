### Why This Project? <br>
As a data analyst for the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), my first mission was to analyze our historical loan data and provide clear, data-driven insights. The goal? To understand borrowing patterns, identify top borrowers, and detect trends that can guide future lending strategies.
With billions in loans across dozens of countries, I knew SQL was the fastest and most reliable way to extract exactly what decision-makers needed.
